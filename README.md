# People-Analytics-Project Employee Attrition & Performance
In this repo you can find my Python script, which I developed as part of my training as a data analyst at CareerFoundry.

### Overview of the whole module 
* Sourcing Open Data

* Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering
* Sourcing & Analyzing Time Series Data
* Creating Data Dashboards


Data Sourcing: The data set was found through the blog post “7 HR Data Sets for People Analytics” from AIHR (ACADEMY TO INNOVATE HR). The data set is available on Kaggle and was uploaded 6 years ago. Originally, the data set was published on IBM’s website but has been removed. 

Data Collection: The data set is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. It is a bit difficult to practice “People Analytics” on real data sets. Due to privacy & security guidelines of companies there are hardly any real-world data sets available open source. 

Data Contents: The original data set “IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance” consist of 37 columns and 1470 rows. The data set contains data like age, gender, job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, education field, job role, income, overtime, percentage salary hike, tenure, training time, years in current role, relationship status, and more. 

Data Limitations and Ethics: Since the data set is a fictional data set it might lack here and there to portray a real workforce data set. No geographical data was included, so I created a new column and randomly filled it with 10 different countries. The data set does not include any names so it can be traced back to any individual person (the data is fictional anyways). 

Data Relevancy: With the mentioned variables, IBM has created a fairly complete overview that contains the data of the average HRIS (Human Resources Information System) combined with a full engagement survey. The data set is therefore great to predict turnover, or to simply find differences between the group that stayed or that left.
